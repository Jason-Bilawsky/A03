**How to use GITHUB** First thing you must do is to create an account. Go through all the steps given, such as putting in an email address and your username. After this, you must install Git, which is like a local version of GitHub. Once this is installed, you can create a repository, which is a fancy name for a project. Everything you will need can be stored here, including links, files, images and videos. Within this repository, you can create a README, which essentially is an outline of what this project is doing or what it is intended to do. Next, you can create a branch, which acts as a copy of the main version of your project. After you make changes to the branch, you must commit them, which is another way of saying you must save your changes. The next step is a pull request, which notifies relevant people that changes are being made. Finally, you have to merge the pull request, which then puts any changes you made into the master file, and allows all users to see the updated file.

**How to use GIT** Using Git is very similar to Github, the main difference is that git is local and github is not. While it is possible to use Git without using Github, you can not use Github without using Git. The tutorial on how to use Github written above will cover how to use Git as well.

**How to use Webstorm** Similar to using Github, to begin you must create an account. Put in your school email address and username to get started, as well as setting a password. Once the account is created and the IDE is opened, you must first create a project. After a project is created, you can begin to write your code. As you go along, Webstorm will help to point out errors and autofill lines (such as automatically closing statements). The IDE can also be fully customized to look however you want. Whether this means you make something that is pleasing to your eyes or that helps to avoid eye strain, the possibilites are endless. Webstorm also has a built in voice call function as well as ways to navigate through the file when looking for something specific.
